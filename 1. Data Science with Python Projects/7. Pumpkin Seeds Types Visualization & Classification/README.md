# Pumpkin Classification Project üéÉ

## Project Overview

The Pumpkin Classification Project leverages a dataset from Kaggle to classify different types of pumpkins based on various attributes. This project applies machine learning techniques to predict pumpkin types, enhancing agricultural management and optimizing pumpkin farming processes. The project is divided into several key stages: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualization, Model Building, and Evaluation.

- **Dataset**: The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains various features describing pumpkins.
- **Project Objectives**: The primary goal is to build a robust model that accurately classifies pumpkin types using different machine learning algorithms. 

## Key Components

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) üîç
   - Detailed analysis of the dataset to understand the distribution, patterns, and relationships between different features.
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing steps to handle missing values and outliers.

### 2. Data Visualization üìä
   - Visualizing the distribution of features using histograms, scatter plots, and KDE plots.
   - Use of Seaborn for advanced plotting and Matplotlib for customization.
